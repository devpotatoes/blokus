# Console-based Blokus

## Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is mainly intended for Linux.  
> It may require adjustments to work on Windows or macOS.

This project is a console-based implementation of the Blokus board game in C.

It features a text-based interface, support for up to 4 players (human or AI), multiple AI difficulty levels, real-time board and score display, and robust input handling.

It was originally a school project, but I took more time to go a bit further. It is also my first C project !
